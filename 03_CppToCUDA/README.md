The program solves the closest neighbor problem via brute force method.
A simple C++ code can be accessed in the ```main.cpp``` file. I applied CUDA to this C++ code to improve its performance. 
For flexibility, CPU or GPU implementation of the program can be chosen inside the ```mainGPU.cu```.

The results are remarkable! With 20 iterations, the fastest time for CPU is 63 seconds while only 0.187 seconds for GPU! Amazzzzinggg!
